[introduction]
= Introduction

iot-services is a RESTful web service for creating and storing spas and spa related information. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

[getting-started]
= Getting started



[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
iot-services is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://iotdev01/git/iot-services.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd iot-services
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.



[getting-started-creating-a-spa]
== Creating a spa
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new spa. As you saw above, the URI for working with spas is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a spa, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the serial number, product id, and model name of the spa:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created spa:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created spa you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the spa's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the spa's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/2/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `spas` link which we'll make use of later.



[getting-started-creating-a-spa]
== Creating a tag
To make a spa easier to find, it can be associated with a dealer or and owner. To be able
to assign and owner to a spa, you must first create the owner.

Referring back to the response for the service's index, the URI for working with owners is
include as a link:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a owner you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the name of the owner:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/3/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created tag:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/3/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created tag you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the tag's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/4/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the tag's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/4/http-response.adoc[]

[getting-started-tagging-a-spa]
== Tagging a spa
A tag isn't particularly useful until it's been associated with one or more notes. There
are two ways to tag a note: when the note is first created or by updating an existing
note. We'll look at both of these in turn.



[getting-started-tagging-a-note-creating]
=== Creating a tagged note
The process is largely the same as we saw before, but this time, in addition to providing
a title and body for the note, we'll also provide the tag that we want to be associated
with it.

Once again we execute a `POST` request. However, this time, in an array named tags, we
include the URI of the tag we just created:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/curl-request.adoc[]

Once again, the response's `Location` header tells us the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/http-response.adoc[]

As before, a `GET` request executed against this URI will retrieve the note's details:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/http-response.adoc[]

To verify that the tag has been associated with the note, we can perform a `GET` request
against the URI from the `tags` link:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/curl-request.adoc[]

The response embeds information about the tag that we've just associated with the note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/http-response.adoc[]



[getting-started-tagging-a-note-existing]
=== Tagging an existing note
An existing note can be tagged by executing a `PATCH` request against the note's URI with
a body that contains the array of tags to be associated with the note. We'll used the
URI of the untagged note that we created earlier:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should produce a `204 No Content` response:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/http-response.adoc[]

When we first created this note, we noted the tags link included in its details:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/2/http-response.adoc[]

We can use that link now and execute a `GET` request to see that the note now has a
single tag:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/http-response.adoc[]
