[introduction]
= Introduction

iot-services is a RESTful web service for creating and storing spas and spa related information. It uses hypermedia
to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.

[getting-started]
= Getting started



[getting-started-running-the-service]
== Running the service
iot-services is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://iotdev01/git/iot-services.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd iot-services
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar target/*.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index/1/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)] format:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.


[getting-started-user-types-and-roles]
== Users and Roles

The system supports different types of users with various capabilities.
The following describes different types of actors that use they system, and
how their user experience with the application is determined by their role assignments.

=== Owner

The owner or person who is going to be using the spa.
The primary UI for the owner is the mobile application.
The web application may also be used by the owner.

Within the web app, the owner may:

* control their own spa
* set temperature
* control spa components
* view their own spa
* view system information
* download Support Materials
* view the spa equipment list with serial numbers
* View Alerts
* Manage their individual account
* see warranty status and experation date

=== Dealer

A spa dealership may have a few different actors using the system for different needs. As such, there are 3 dealer roles
that may be assigned to a dealer type user. (and must have at least one)


ADMIN role:

* May create new dealership users
* May inactivate dealership user accounts
* May inactivate owner accounts


ASSOCIATE role:

An associate sells spas to owners, and deals with customers. A DEALER user with ASSOCIATE role may:

* view the dealership dashboard page
* view a list of all spas associated with the dealership
* view a list of all alerts for all dealership spas
* view all alerts associated with a single spa
* view the details associate with any individual alert
* view a list of all of the dealership’s spas
* view the details of any of the spas associated by the dealership including
* view spa system information
* view current state of all spa components
* manage their own user account
* may sell spas and create new owners

* does not control a spa


TECHNICIAN ROLE:

A technician deals with customer service issues. In addition to the spa detail view functionality.
A technician role assigned to a dealer opens access to additional diagnostic and support capabilities.

* fault log
* event log
* wifi statistics
* measurement readings
* technician remote command / control of spa

A technician role does not provide the ability to sell spas.

A Dealer type user may have any or all of the 3 ADMIN, ASSOCIATE, and TECHNICIAN roles. And must have at least one.


=== OEM

An OEM user may view spas from multiple dealers.
An OEM may not see spa or user data associated with other OEMs
An OEM with ADMIN ROLE may:

* create new OEM users
* create Dealer entities
* create Dealer user with ADMIN role (during createion of Dealer)

=== BWG

BWG users may see spa and user information for all spas in the system.

A BWG user with Admin may

* create other BWG users.
* create OEM entitities
* create a new OEM User with ADMIN role (during creation of the OEM)

=== User Constraints

An owner may not also have other roles. For example a single user may not be both an OWNER and a DEALER ASSOCIATE.
For this use case. The person needs two accounts, one for work, one for home. Using separate email addresses.


Only one spa per account. A person may have multiple accounts each using a unique email address.



[getting-started-creating-a-spa]
== Creating a spa
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new spa. As you saw above, the URI for working with spas is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a spa, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the serial number, product id, and model name of the spa:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/1/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created spa:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/1/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created spa you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example,
you can access the spa's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/2/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the spa's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/2/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `spas` link which we'll make use of later.



[getting-adding-a-new-user]
== Creating a new User
To make a spa easier to find, it can be associated with a dealer or and owner. To be able
to assign and owner to a spa, you must first create the owner.

Referring back to the response for the service's index, the URI for working with owners is
include as a link:

include::{snippets}/index/1/http-response.adoc[]

To create a owner you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI, including a JSON
payload containing the name of the owner:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/3/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created tag:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/3/http-response.adoc[]

To work with the newly created tag you use the URI in the `Location` header. For example
you can access the tag's details by performing a `GET` request:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/4/curl-request.adoc[]

This request will produce a response with the tag's details in its body:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-spa/4/http-response.adoc[]



[Authentication / Authorization]
== Authentication

== Authorization

[user-terms-and-conditions]
== Terms And Condition Agreements

Users of the application must first agree to the terms and conditions of use.
When someone uses the application for the first time, they will be shown the terms and conditions of use,
and asked to accept the terms before continuing.

Typical Mobile Application Workflow:

Assuming that the user is not already authenticated:
Step 1: POST to the login API

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/1/curl-request.adoc[]

Note:  This is a dummy login for development environment.
        Once the identity management server is ready. This URL will change.

        If the return code is 403 (or 401), then login failed. Most likely a bad username or password.

If return is 200 OK, the the user has passed authentication.
This request will produce a response with the users’s details in its body:

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/1/http-response.adoc[]

Get userId from response payload and use it in step 2

Step 2: use findCurrentUserAgreement API to determine if the user has already agreed to the current version
    of the terms and conditions of use.

This curl command shows an example of finding a user agreement

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/2/curl-request.adoc[]

If, as in this example, the response code is 200, then yes, the user has already agreed.

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/2/http-response.adoc[]

Let's send them to the page they are really interested in going to their landing page.
Skip the rest and Go to Step 5


If the response if 404,
include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/3/http-response.adoc[]


This indicates the user has not yet agreed to the current terms and
conditions of use.  We'll need to display it to them and ask them to agree.
Proceed to step 3

Step 3: use the findMostRecent API to fetch the current terms and conditions of use

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/4/curl-request.adoc[]

The response payload includes the most recent Terms and Conditions used by this application.
Display them to the user and ask them to accept.

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/4/http-response.adoc[]

Step 4:  When user agrees, POST to the /tac/agree API, so we'll know not to ask them in the future.

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/5/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/terms-and-conditions/5/http-request.adoc[]

Upon a successful post, 201, let's send them on to their landing page.

Step 5: The landing page for the mobile application will want to find the spa for this user

GET  /spas/search/findByUsername?username=chynde


Note: Creating a new version of the terms and conditions of use will mark all of the current user agreements as old.

[getting-started-tagging-a-spa]
== Tagging a spa
A tag isn't particularly useful until it's been associated with one or more notes. There
are two ways to tag a note: when the note is first created or by updating an existing
note. We'll look at both of these in turn.



[getting-started-tagging-a-note-creating]
=== Creating a tagged note
The process is largely the same as we saw before, but this time, in addition to providing
a title and body for the note, we'll also provide the tag that we want to be associated
with it.

Once again we execute a `POST` request. However, this time, in an array named tags, we
include the URI of the tag we just created:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/curl-request.adoc[]

Once again, the response's `Location` header tells us the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/5/http-response.adoc[]

As before, a `GET` request executed against this URI will retrieve the note's details:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/6/http-response.adoc[]

To verify that the tag has been associated with the note, we can perform a `GET` request
against the URI from the `tags` link:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/curl-request.adoc[]

The response embeds information about the tag that we've just associated with the note:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/7/http-response.adoc[]



[getting-started-tagging-a-note-existing]
=== Tagging an existing note
An existing note can be tagged by executing a `PATCH` request against the note's URI with
a body that contains the array of tags to be associated with the note. We'll used the
URI of the untagged note that we created earlier:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should produce a `204 No Content` response:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/8/http-response.adoc[]

When we first created this note, we noted the tags link included in its details:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/2/http-response.adoc[]

We can use that link now and execute a `GET` request to see that the note now has a
single tag:

include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/creating-a-note/9/http-response.adoc[]
